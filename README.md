## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workshop dropdown is empty**:
   - Check that `workshops.txt` exists and contains workshop titles
   - Ensure each workshop is on a separate line
   - Check browser console for loading errors

2. **PDF not downloading**:
   - Ensure browser allows downloads
   - Check that jsPDF library is loading correctly
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Site not loading on GitHub Pages**:
   - Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
   - Check that all files are committed and pushed
   - Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete

### Browser Console
Open developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for any error messages or debugging information.

## üîê Secure Certificate Logging Setup (GitHub Pages)

To prevent fraudulent certificate usage and enable staff monitoring, the system logs all certificate generations to a Google Sheet that only authorized staff can access.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Create Google Apps Script
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the contents of `google-apps-script.js`
4. Save the project with a name like "Certificate Logger"

#### 2. Deploy the Script
1. Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
2. Choose type: "Web app"
3. **Critical settings:**
   - ‚úÖ **Execute as:** "Me"
   - ‚úÖ **Who has access:** "Anyone" (not "Anyone with Google account")
4. Click "Deploy"
5. **Copy the deployment URL** (you'll need this for the next step)

#### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets (Recommended for GitHub Pages)
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
3. **Click "New repository secret"**
4. **Name:** `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL`
5. **Value:** Your Google Apps Script deployment URL
6. **Click "Add secret"**

#### 4. Enable GitHub Pages with Actions
1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages**
2. **Source:** "GitHub Actions"
3. **The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to main**

#### 5. Manual Deployment (When Updating Secrets)
If you update the `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` secret, you can manually trigger a new deployment:
1. **Go to the Actions tab in your repository**
2. **Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow**
3. **Click "Run workflow" button**
4. **Select the main branch and click "Run workflow"**
5. **Wait for the deployment to complete**

#### 6. Alternative: Local Development
For local testing, uncomment this line in `script.js`:
```javascript
// GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID_HERE/exec';
```
**Important:** Don't commit this change to your repository!

#### 7. Test the Setup
1. **Push your changes to trigger deployment** (or use manual trigger)
2. **Generate a test certificate on your live site**
3. **Check your Google Drive for "Bioinformatics Certificate Log"**
4. **Verify the entry appears in the sheet**

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

‚úÖ **URL Hidden**: Google Apps Script URL is stored securely in GitHub Secrets  
‚úÖ **No Public Exposure**: URL never appears in your public repository  
‚úÖ **Access Control**: Only repository admins can view/edit secrets  
‚úÖ **Automatic Deployment**: Secrets are injected during GitHub Actions build  
‚úÖ **Fraud Prevention**: Detailed logging helps identify suspicious activity  

### üîß How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** reads the `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` secret during deployment
2. **Creates `config.json`** with the URL during the build process
3. **Website loads** the URL from `config.json` at runtime
4. **Logging works** seamlessly without exposing sensitive data

### üìä What Gets Logged

Each certificate generation records:
- **Timestamp**: When the certificate was generated
- **Name**: Participant's name
- **Email**: Participant's email
- **Workshop**: Full workshop title and date
- **User Agent**: Browser information (for fraud detection)

### üë• Staff Monitoring

**Access the Log:**
- The Google Sheet is automatically created in your Google Drive
- Only you (and accounts you explicitly share with) can view the log
- The sheet updates in real-time as certificates are generated

**Fraud Detection Features:**
- Timestamps help identify unusual generation patterns
- Email addresses can be cross-referenced with workshop attendance
- Browser information helps identify automated/bot activity
- Workshop dates help verify legitimate certificate requests

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Review the log weekly or after each workshop
- Look for duplicate names/emails for the same workshop
- Check for certificates generated outside reasonable timeframes
- Verify email addresses match your workshop registration records

### üö® Troubleshooting

**If logging isn't working:**
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify the GitHub Secret is set correctly
3. Ensure GitHub Actions deployment completed successfully
4. Test the Google Apps Script directly using the `testLogging` function

**Common issues:**
- **401 errors**: Redeploy Google Apps Script with correct permissions
- **No config.json**: GitHub Actions may have failed - check the Actions tab
- **Secret not found**: Verify the secret name is exactly `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL`
