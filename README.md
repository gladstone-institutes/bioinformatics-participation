### For Staff

#### Viewing Activity Logs
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for real-time certificate generation logs
- Each entry includes: date, participant name, email, and workshop title

#### Exporting Activity Logs
- Use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+E` (or `Cmd+Shift+E` on Mac)
- This downloads a CSV file with all certificate generation records
- File includes: Date, Name, Email, Workshop columns

#### Managing Workshop List
- Edit the `workshops.txt` file to add, remove, or modify workshop titles
- Each workshop should be on a separate line
- Changes take effect immediately when the page is refreshed

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Workshop Titles
Edit `workshops.txt` to modify the available workshops:
```
Introduction to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
Python Programming for Biologists
R for Genomic Data Analysis
...
```

### Certificate Design
Modify the `generateCertificate()` function in `script.js` to customize:
- Colors and fonts
- Layout and spacing
- Institution name and branding
- Certificate text and formatting

### Styling

## üîê Secure Certificate Logging Setup

To prevent fraudulent certificate usage and enable staff monitoring, the system logs all certificate generations to a Google Sheet that only authorized staff can access.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Create Google Apps Script
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the contents of `google-apps-script.js`
4. Save the project with a name like "Certificate Logger"

#### 2. Deploy the Script
1. Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
2. Choose type: "Web app"
3. Set execute as: "Me"
4. Set access: "Anyone" (this allows the website to send data)
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Copy the deployment URL

#### 3. Configure the Website
1. Open `script.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE` with your deployment URL
3. Save and deploy your website

#### 4. Test the Setup
1. Generate a test certificate
2. Check your Google Drive for a new spreadsheet called "Bioinformatics Certificate Log"
3. Verify the entry appears in the sheet

### What Gets Logged

Each certificate generation records:
- **Timestamp**: When the certificate was generated
- **Name**: Participant's name
- **Email**: Participant's email
- **Workshop**: Full workshop title and date
- **User Agent**: Browser information (for fraud detection)

### Staff Monitoring

**Access the Log:**
- The Google Sheet is automatically created and shared with the Google account that deployed the script
- Only you (and accounts you explicitly share with) can view the log
- The sheet updates in real-time as certificates are generated

**Fraud Detection Features:**
- Timestamps help identify unusual generation patterns
- Email addresses can be cross-referenced with actual workshop attendance
- Browser information helps identify automated/bot activity
- Workshop dates help verify legitimate certificate requests

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Review the log weekly or after each workshop
- Look for duplicate names/emails for the same workshop
- Check for certificates generated outside of reasonable timeframes
- Verify email addresses match your workshop registration records
